# Rabbit Hole 1

You're having a grand old time clicking through the rabbit hole that is your favorite online encyclopedia.

The encyclopedia consists of $N$ different web pages, numbered from $1$ to $N$. Each page $i$ contains nothing but a single link to a different page $L_i$. 

A session spent on this website involves beginning on one of the $N$ pages, and then navigating around using the links until you decide to stop. That is, while on page $i$, you may either move to page $L_i$, or stop your browsing session.

Assuming you can choose which page you begin the session on, what's the maximum number of different pages you can visit in a single session? Note that a page only counts once even if visited multiple times during the session.

## Constraints

$2 \leq  N \leq 500000 $ \
$1 \leq  L_i \leq N$ \
$L_i \neq i$
