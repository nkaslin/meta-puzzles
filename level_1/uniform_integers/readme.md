# Uniform Integers

A positive integer is considered uniform if all of its digits are equal. For example, $222$ is uniform, while $223$ is not.

Given two positive integers $A$ and $B$, determine the number of uniform integers between $A$ and $B$, inclusive.

Please take care to write a solution which runs within the time limit.

## Constraints
$1 \leq A \leq B \leq 10^{12}$
