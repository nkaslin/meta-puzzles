# All Wrong

There's a multiple-choice test with $N$ questions, numbered from $1$ to $N$. Each question has $2$ answer options, labelled A and B. You know that the correct answer for the $i$-th question is the $i$-th character in the string $C$, which is either "A" or "B", but you want to get a score of $0$ on this test by answering every question incorrectly.

Your task is to implement the function getWrongAnswers(N, C) which returns a string with $N$ characters, the $i$-th of which is the answer you should give for question $i$ in order to get it wrong (either "A" or "B").
